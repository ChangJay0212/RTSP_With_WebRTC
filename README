# RTSP Streaming with GStreamer

This project demonstrates how to use **GStreamer** to generate, process, and display **RTSP streams**. It includes examples for generating RTSP streams from a local camera, converting RTSP to HLS, and viewing the stream in a web browser.

---

## Features

- **RTSP Stream Generation**: Use GStreamer to capture video from a local camera and generate an RTSP stream.
- **Stream Processing**: Convert RTSP to other formats, such as HLS or MP4.
- **Browser Playback**: Play HLS streams directly in a web browser using a simple HTML template.
- **Lightweight and Flexible**: All functionality runs with GStreamer pipelines or lightweight Python scripts.

- **GStreamer** (with plugins):
  - `gstreamer1.0-tools`
  - `gstreamer1.0-plugins-base`
  - `gstreamer1.0-plugins-good`
  - `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`
  - `gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
  - `gstreamer1.0-libav`
- **Python** (if running Python scripts)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
